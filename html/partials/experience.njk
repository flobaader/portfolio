                    I founded this startup two years ago to implement own software projects. We're currently developing our own software and doing client projects.
                    <p><b>C#/WPF</b>: I developed the system tool <a href="https://www.econap.de">Econap</a>, which intelligently activates the energy saving mode. In addition to many prizes from various competitions, we successfully sell the tool to private individuals and companies. </p>
                    <p><b>Android</b>: I built, designed and published a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.selectcode.kinderserienquiz">quiz app</a> in Kotlin from scratch. The app has a rating of 4.7 stars and more than 8000 downloads. </p>
                    <p><b>Xamarin</b>: For a gym I developed an app that allows members to view, book and manage courses.</p>
                    <p><b>Cloud</b>: I migrated our entire company infrastructure, e.g. various backends for Econap, to the cloud. I have also built many CI/CD pipelines that allow us to be agile.</p>

                <p>QAware has a so called radiator, which is a software that displays the build state and metrics like lines of code of their projects on big screens.
                 This application had lots of performance problems and stability issues. I've managed to solve them by rebuilding this application with a <b>Spring Boot microservice</b> architecture. The application was deployed to <b>Kubernetes in the Google Cloud</b>.</p>
